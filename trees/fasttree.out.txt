ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -193662.736 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 2.60
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)14 of 20   
Rate categories were divided by 0.821 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
